# Mission Type Setup Guide

The operation method and reward distribution structure of missions vary depending on the mission type, round (instance), and achievement goal settings.
Please select the mission type that best suits your purpose by referring to the examples below.

## SINGLE - Single Goal Mission

* Rewards are distributed upon achieving the single goal.
* Depending on whether rounds are set, it can be operated as a one-time mission.

| Field | Value  | Example |
| ----- | ------ | ------- |
| Mission Type | SINGLE | SINGLE  |
| Rounds     | Not Set    | 1       |
| Achievement Goal | Number of Achievements  | 1       |

### Operation Mechanism

* Mission completes immediately upon goal achievement
* Cannot be repeated

## SINGLE - Repeat Goal Mission

* Used when you want to encourage the same action to be repeated per session.
* Operates as a repeat mission depending on the round setting.

| Field | Value   | Example |
| ----- | ------- | ------- |
| Mission Type | SINGLE  | SINGLE  |
| Rounds   | Set to 2 or more | 2       |
| Achievement Goal | Number of Achievements   | 1       |

### Operation Method

| Round | Goal | Achieved | Status |
| --- | -- | -- | -- |
| 1st Round | 1  | 1  | Complete |
| 2nd Round | 1  | 1  | Complete |

## ACCUMULATE - Cumulative Achievement Mission

* The target value is fixed, and the achievement count accumulates even when the round changes.
* Rewards are granted when the cumulative count reaches the target.

| Field | Value      | Example    |
| ----- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Mission Type | ACCUMULATE | ACCUMULATE |
| Rounds     | Set to 2 or more    | 3          |
| Achievement Goal | Cumulative Achievement Count   | 10         |

### How It Works

⚠️ **Achievement counts are NOT reset** when changing rounds.

| Round | Goal | Achieved | Status        |
| --- | -- | -- | --------- |
| Round 1 | 10 | 4  | 4/10, In Progress |
| Round 2 | 10 | 7  | 7/10, In Progress |
| Round 3 | 10 | 10 | 10/10, Complete |

## DIFFICULTY — Increasing Difficulty Mission

* The difficulty of the achievement goal increases with each round.
* If the number of rounds and the number of difficulty settings do not match, it resets to the initial difficulty.

⚠️ It is recommended to set the number of rounds and the number of difficulty settings to be the same.

| Field | Value      | Example    |
| ----- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Mission Type | DIFFICULTY | DIFFICULTY |
| Rounds     | Set to 2 or more    | 4          |
| Achievement Goals | Difficulty Level     | 20,40,60   |

### How It Works

| Round    | Goal                                                 | Achieved | Status         |
| --- | -------------------------------------------------- | -- | ---------- |
| 1st Round | 20                                                 | 10 | 10/20, In Progress |
| 2nd Round | 40                                                 | 5  | 5/40, In Progress  |
| 3rd Round | 60                                                 | 40 | 40/60, In Progress |
| 4th Round | <p>20<br>⚠️ If the number of rounds and difficulty settings don&#x27;t match, it resets to the initial difficulty</p> | 20 | 20/20, Complete  |

## CHALLENGE - Collection Mission

* This mission bundles multiple missions into a single set.
* All missions must be completed to receive rewards.

| Field | Value     | Example   |
| ----- | --------- | --------- |
| Mission Type | CHALLENGE | CHALLENGE |
| Rounds       | Not Set       | 1         |
| Achievement Goal | Related Mission ID  | 1,2,3     |
